I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the Center for *Signal Processing, Imaging, Reasoning, and Learning* <a href='https://web.northeastern.edu/spiral/'>(SPIRAL)</a>, affiliated with the <a href='https://ece.northeastern.edu/'>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://lilisu3.sites.northeastern.edu'> Prof. Lili Su</a>. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering all from Wuhan Univeristy.

My current research interest lies in the intersection of optimization, distributed computing, fault-tolerance and machine learning. Concretely, recent work focuses mostly on robust and efficient federated learning with provable guarantees. 
In general, the goal is to design statistical-sound algorithms that are also robust to system faults and efficient in implementation at the same time. 
Faults may arise from various sources, including communication issues, hardware/software constraints, malfunctions, etc.

I am open to **collaboration and internships.**
If you find my research interesting, please feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:xiang.mi@northeastern.edu"> email</a>.
